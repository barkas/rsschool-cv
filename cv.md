#### Profile

#### Code example
Function to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

```
function squareDigits(num){
  const numbers = String(num).split('');
  let result = '';
  for (let number of numbers) {
    result = result + number*number;    
  }
  return Number(result);
}
```
